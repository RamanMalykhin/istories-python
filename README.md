I have taken a series of online workshops from a Russian investigative journalism resource istories.media. 
Those were aimed at introducting someone to Python from scratch and can be found here https://istories.media/workshops/.

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks where I was working through the materials. They were my first introduction to coding in Python.
